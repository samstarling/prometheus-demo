# prometheus-example

A repository that uses `docker-compose` to bring up:

* Prometheus, for scraping metrics.
* Pushgateway, to collect metrics (from the `push_data.sh` script.)
* Grafana, as a UI.

## TODO

* Grafana config "out of the box".
* Something to put more meaningful test data into the system.
